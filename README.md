## Overview
A Simple notifications page where the user can toggle notifications as read or unread. The notification counter should update the number of un-read notifications
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1. Add all HTML
2. Add all CSS styles for Laptop view.
3. Add all CSS styles for Mobile view.
4. Add all active styles
5. Add interective code with Javascript
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This project has served to reinforce my javascript and CSS knowledge. I had a few challenges but I was able to overcome with some solutions I found.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I still want to improve my CSS grid, Flexbox and Javascript skills. Specially javascript.
